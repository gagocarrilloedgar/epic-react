### Declarative vs Imperative

The best way for me to understand if you know nothing about *declarative vs imperative* programming is thinkging about:

> Declarative: are those fucntions you simply ask, you get them and you can use them.
> Imperative: are those functions you need to actually write every step of the way by sourfelf.

And these definitions really fall under the *WHAT: Declarative* and *HOW: Imperative*

When thinking about **WHAT**, think of JS built in funcitons, react components that are simply given to you.

And on the contrary when thinking about **HOW** think about C or C++, where even if you have read a simple array you need to create 
your function in order to do it. You need to tell C/C++ every step they need to do in order for the program to work.
